# Different-Silica-Supports-Catalyst-Synthesis-for-Hydrodesulfurization-Under-Graduate-Project-UGP
This project is based on developing and validating Ni–Mo catalysts supported on amorphous Al₂O₃ blended with different silica supports (MCM-41, SBA-15, KIT-6, SiO₂) for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of refractory sulfur compounds (e.g., dibenzothiophene).
