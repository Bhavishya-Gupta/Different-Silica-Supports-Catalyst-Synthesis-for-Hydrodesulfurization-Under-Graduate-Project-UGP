### 🔬 Theoretical Background

#### Hydrodesulfurization Chemistry
The HDS process involves the removal of sulfur from organic compounds through two main pathways:

1. **Direct Desulfurization (DDS)**
   - \( C_{12}H_8S + 2H_2 \rightarrow C_{12}H_{10} + H_2S \)
   - Biphenyl formation pathway
   - Preferred for deep desulfurization

2. **Hydrogenation Route (HYD)**
   - \( C_{12}H_8S + 5H_2 \rightarrow C_{12}H_{16}S + 3H_2 \rightarrow C_{12}H_{16} + H_2S \)
   - Cyclohexylbenzene formation
   - Higher hydrogen consumption

#### Catalyst Design Principles
- **Active Phase**: MoS₂ slabs with Ni promoter
